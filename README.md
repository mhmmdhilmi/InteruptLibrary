# PWM Interupt

You can use this library for decoding PWM value from Pixhawk to arduino

## Prerequisites

* Mission Planner
* Arduino IDE
* Pixhawk
* Arduino Mega/Uno


### Installing


`$ git clone ~mhmmdhilmi/InteruptLibrary.git`

* Open Interupt.ino
* Change the pin based on connected pin between arduino and pixhawk
* Upload the program to arduino

## Running the tests

* Run your pixhawk with [Antenna Tracker Firmware](http://ardupilot.org/antennatracker/docs/loading-the-firmware.html)
* Full documentation about Antenna Tracker using Pixhawk ( [See Documentation](http://ardupilot.org/antennatracker/index.html) )
* After the program uploaded, check your Serial within baud rate 115200 
* for verifying the programs, change yaw servo or pitch servo value
